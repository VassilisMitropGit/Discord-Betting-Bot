# Discord Betting Bot

This is a small personal project I created using **Node.js** and the discord Javascript framework, **discord.js**. It serves as a digital currency and betting system for any discord server as it allows it's users to make bets and check each other's balances.
I used **Mongo Db** as the project's database.

# Deploy

The project runs with the command *"node bot.js"*. It can be deployed online with any service such as deep ocean, glitch, repl.it, etc.
I used **Repl.it** and via **Uptime Robot** the bot stays awake so that it doesn't close from inactivity.
